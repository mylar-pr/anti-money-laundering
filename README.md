Money laundering is the process used to disguise the source of money or assets derived from criminal activity. Money laundering involves approximately  $590  billion to  $1.5  trillion USD per year worldwide. In 2018,  $46.7  billion was laundered through Canada with  $7.4  billion accounted in British Columbia. Canadian real state is a prime target for money laundering. For banks, it is important to comply the legislation from FINTRAC and OSFI.

In terms of the model, it is important to reduce the false positive alarms while having very low tolerance to false negatives. False negatives, are critical because they may be problematic for the bank in terms of legislation and affect the reputation of the bank. It is important to analyze the context of the transactions/users relationships to improve effectiveness of the alarms.
